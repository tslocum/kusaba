# Introduction #

kusaba was designed from the ground up with a simple idea:

  * Keep things easy to understand and maintain for the site administrators
  * Make everything as painless to do as possible
  * Appeal to the widest audience.

kusaba gives you better control over your website, ease of use and great support.  I have my details posted on the Comments board on how to contact me, and I'll help you with any problem you encounter.

# Features #

Here is a quick rundown of the main points of kusaba:

  * The normal -chan style website has already been built for you.  Users visiting the front page will be presented with an auto generated menu with sections you designate, and a news page with entries you add through the manage panel.
  * Adding additional boards is as easy as going to the Add Board page, typing in the board's name and directory, and clicking submit.
  * Changing a board's options is very easy as well.  Click Board Options, select the board you which to change the options of from the drop down menu, and click submit.  You will be presented with all of the different customizable attributes of that board
  * No need for separate software to get text-style boards as well!  Simply change a board's type in the board options page, and you have a text board!
  * Easy to use staff system.  Boards don't have a single moderation password, you create staff accounts and assign each their own privileges.  You can also add a staff account and flag it as an administrator, giving it control over all boards, along with full access to the manage panel.  (News, addition/deletion of boards, word filter system, etc)
  * Administrator/moderator actions are kept in a log showing what they did, and when they did it.
  * Very fast and easy to use post deletion and user banning system.  After logging into the manage panel, viewing a board will automatically create links next to each post's ID to the corresponding manage panel page to take that action.  See the screen shot below for how it will look.
  * Don't speak English very well?  Trying to make a -chan for others who don't speak English fluently?  No problem!  Translation efforts are currently taking place, and German/Norwegian translations are almost complete!  Using another language instead of English in kusaba is as easy as changing the locale to another of the currently supported locales.

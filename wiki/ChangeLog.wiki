= 0.9.8 =
  * TC_NOMESSAGETHREAD and TC_NOMESSAGEREPLY have been added, which can be used set as replacement text for posts made with no message

  * Inline image expansion now works with IE, Opera, and Safari, instead of exclusively Firefox
  * The Headline style has been stolen from Kareha, and may now be used on text boards
  * TC_DIRTITLE has been added, which decides whether or not to include the board's directory in the title and at the top of the page.  Eg. with true, /b/ would be shown as "/b/ - Random", false would be shown as "Random"

  * TC_BANMSG has been added, allowing you to easily configure what message should be used when placing a ban
  * Adding the ban message set by TC_BANMSG is now optional, and is set while placing the ban using a checkbox.  As a result, TC_ADDBANMSG has been removed
  * All paths are now calculated at runtime by default, making it even easier to configure Trevorchan (and stop so many people coming to ask how to edit them)

= 0.9.7 =

  * Trial/Popular boards will now display properly in the menu
  * Upload board pages displaying all entries will now correctly label threads marked for deletion
  * The menu displayed on the front page is now only generated when changes are made through the manage boards panel which reflect on it.  It is saved to two html files, one showing directories, and the other not
  * Translations work again

  * The news page has been restyled, and now includes links which point directly to any given news post
  * Access keys have a few additions to make the entire post box accessible
  * Users may now use built in shortcuts to jump from thread to thread on board pages, using the alt key and either ' or ].  They may also change pages with ; or [, also using the alt key.  They may also go directly to the postbox area by pressing alt+p.  This currently seems to only work in Firefox
  * First 100/Last 50 posts pages are now generated if TC_FIRSTLAST is set to true
  * aa tags may be used around text art to display properly
  * A spoiler tag has been added

= 0.9.6 =
  * Modifications have been made to make Trevorchan compatible with a fresh install of XAMPP.  IIS testing is planned in the near future
  * APC has been integrated, caching the configuration and replies to threads, and can be enabled by setting TC_APC to true
  * VIP codes may be added in the staff page, which uses only the username field.  When added, a post may be made with the username placed in the mod password field, and will make ## VIP ## appear on the post.  VIP users may not log in to the manage panel, nor use any of the checkbox options during posting
  * Threads are now marked for deletion in two hours when they reach the specified mark page.  The default is 9, and can be set per-board
  * A CGI path can be set pointing to where the manage files, the board.php file, and the oekaki files are kept
  * Boards now generate a "catalog" of the threads in catalog.html, which can be disabled by a setting in the board options page.  Catalogs are only  generated for normal imageboards and oekaki imageboards.  The catalog consists of a very small thumbnail for each thread's picture, along with the number of replies, giving a much broader look at all of the threads on the board.  This is not retroactive, because it requires a second thumbnailing, which means once enabled, it will take a while before the catalog looks as it should.  Fresh installations of v0.9.6 will not have this problem
  * Replies which contain an image will be thumbnailed at a maximum of 125 now, instead of the 200 which is used for the thread starting post.  This can be changed in the config
  * A load balancer script is now included in the .OTHER folder.  When an URL and password is set in the board options page, it will attempt to connect to the script, and send it the file the user is attempting to post.  The load balancer will thumbnail and store the script, and serve it until the file is deleted.  Unfortunately, MIME type checking does not work with the load balancer script at this time, because it is lost during the transfer.  I hope to find a fix for this soon
  * The original file name of the file which was uploaded is now displayed in the size/dimension area
  * There is now a directory of chans which can be pinged, and you may set TC_PINGBACK to a string of characters and numbers which will be used as your password when pinging it

= 0.9.5 =
  * Oekaki painters may now choose to use the Selfy palette with either of the Shi-Painter apps
  * Javascript scripts have been moved to lib/javascript/
  * The following take place on all post tables, to reflect the use of non-image files and promote clarity:
   * The column threadid has been renamed to parentid
   * The column user has been renamed to name
   * The column image has been renamed to filename, and now supports a length of 50 instead of 20
   * The column imagetype has been renamed to filetype, and now supports a length of 20 instead of 5
   * The column imagemd5 has been renamed to filemd5
   * The column image_size has been renamed to filesize
  * The boards table has been updated to not have a thread age limit by default, due to numerous reports of people forgetting to increase it further than 96 hours
  * The watched threads box's drag handle is now filled to be more noticeable
  * The watched threads box now is resizeable and will remember its dimensions
  * The watched threads box and the poster information area of thread posts now use icons in place of [] boxes and text
  * The manage stickies/locked threads pages have been redesigned
  * If captcha is enabled for a board, trying to create a new thread or reply without entering anything in the captcha box will stop the form from submitting and raise an alert message
  * You may use your own CSS styles by adding them to the list found in config.php
   * The default style is now set in config.php, and to make a board use that default, set it to "Default Style" in board options
   * Not only can you add styles, you may remove them
   * This also introduces TC_STYLESWITCHER, which will show/hide the list of styles at the top of the page
  * You may now add staff members using the type "Janitor".  Janitors have the single ability to delete posts from boards which you set them to moderate, and nothing else
  * Boards can now be set to the type "Upload imageboard", which will render pages with a more file-friendly look
  * Automatic thread archiving may be enabled on a per-board basis
  * Images may be expanded inline by clicking the filename above the image.  Currently tested to only work in Firefox
  * Due to an increase of reports of false positives through the DNSBL system, it has been dropped.  You may wish to go through and unban all IP addresses blocked with it just in case
  * While banning a post which contained an image, there is an option to ban the hash as well, which will automatically ban any poster who attempts to upload that same image

= 0.9.4 =
  * Delete posts by IP wasn't deleting images correctly while removing posts, which is now fixed
  * TC_POSTDELAY has been split into two configurations, TC_NEWTHREADDELAY and TC_REPLYDELAY
  * TC_MAXPPM has been removed because of the above change, meaning the table iplist is no longer needed
  * config.php is no longer a wall of configuration options, and has been sectioned
  * Quotes (>) were causing an extra line to be placed above them whenever being used after text, which is now fixed
  * Oekaki users may now check the "Use animation" checkbox to have their drawing recorded in pch format as well.  This will place a link at the bottom of their posts for other viewers to view their animation as it was being drawn
  * Quick reply has been implemented, and can be enabled with TC_QUICKREPLY
  * User-added filetypes may now have a MIME type associated with them, requiring any files uploaded of that type to match a specified MIME type
  * Users may now watch threads for new replies by using the thread watch box which floats to the left of the post box.  To disable this, set TC_WATCHTHREADS to false

= 0.9.3 =
  * DNS Block, created by !N3X15, is now available for use in Trevorchan, simply by enabling TC_DNSBL.  DNS Block will automatically ban users found to be using tor or another proxy service, to help prevent ban evasion
  * The inc/ folder has been reorganized a bit.  Pages are now in inc/pages/, and fonts are now in inc/fonts/
  * ADOdb has been removed and replaced with ADOdb Lite.  In this transition query caching was removed.  If you wish to continue caching your queries, it is up to you to find another method
  * A new folder, lib/, has been added.  In it is the libraries for ADOdb Lite, oekaki, Smarty, and gettext
  * The menu and manage panel now uses Smarty for page rendering.  This will hopefully expand to other pages as well
  * If TC_EXPAND is enabled, users will be able to expand threads inside of a board page if they wish by clicking expand in the omitted replies notice
  * The manage panel now has a new way of linking to separate pages.  It resembles the board list from the front page, and gives easier access to the different pages rather than clicking a tab first
  * Regular expressions are now possible in the wordfilter
  * The code styling tag is now fixed (previously, each return in the message would render as two returns)

= 0.9.2 =

  * Moderators/Administrators can delete multiple posts using checkboxes on the board/thread pages (Thanks Steve)
  * RSS feeds can be enabled through config.php, making the file rss.xml in the same folder as board.html (Thanks Steve)
  * Clicking the FAQ / Rules links will take you to a new page.  Clicking FAQ will read from inc/faq.html, and Rules will read from inc/rules.html.  Blog has been removed, as that is an external feature.  Add it back in if you use it
  * Administrators are now able to view the disk space used by individual boards' res/ and thumb/ directories, along with all boards placed together
  * Users can now hide threads they don't wish to see, which will be hidden each visit until they un-hide them
